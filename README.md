# docker-elasticsearch

A dockerfile for [ElasticSearch 1.4.0](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elasticsearch-1-4-0-released/).

The [official image](https://github.com/dockerfile/elasticsearch)
is still stuck at ES 1.3 (I guess they will add support for 1.4
in a separate branch sometime soon); meanwhile, if you wanna
**play** with v1.4 you can simply use this one.
